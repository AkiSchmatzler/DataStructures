# **Data Structures in C : main structures and operations** 
Some basic operations on different data structures that can always come in handy. The tree and graph structure contain some more complex operations such as tree rotations or the Dijkstra algorithm. All structures use pointers, and some structures have a couple different implementation (the list of which is non-exhaustive).

### **Some definitions**: 

#### **stack** : 

A stack is a linear data structure. here's a quick sketch :

The three main operations that are performed in a Stack are:

    * Push: Adds an item in the stack.
    * Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. 
    * Peek or Top: Returns top element of stack.
    * isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.

#### **queue** :
